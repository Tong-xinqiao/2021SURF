This is a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program using PINN to deal with the pressure field of subsurface flow, which is governed by Darcy equation.  

The DNN framework is based on Physics Informed Deep Learning (Part I): Data-driven Solutions of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations by Maziar Raissi, Paris Perdikaris, and George Em Karniadakis.
